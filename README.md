# HW-4.2.
Project with Testing

1. A project has been created, and the JUnit library has been added to it.
2. A class called UserTest and a class called User with fields for login and email have been created. The User class needs to be tested.
3. In the UserTest class, the following tests have been defined:

* A test has been created to test the creation of a User object with two parameters. This function should only check if the data is set correctly when creating the object.
* A similar test has been created to test the creation of a User object without passing any parameters.
* A test has been created to verify whether a correct email address is set in the email field of the User class. An email without the "@" symbol or a dot will be considered incorrect.
* A test has been created to determine if login and email are equal (they should not be equal).
